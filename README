Java Driver API connecting to mongo DB 4.0 running (running in Docker container) 

Quick demo showing how to connect to mongo db 4.0 with new Java Driver API.

The Java Application connects to an already running Mongo DB instance on port 27017
on the "admin" database using root user credentials used by looking at environmental variables
"MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME" and "MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD"
		
Once connected, the application will enter a loop in which it will insert a new Documents into the "metrics" 
collection every 5 secods. The documents consists of a randomly generated a domain name (random string) 
along with a random hit/visit count.

Its is compiled as an uber jar (with all dependancies) needed in order to be run via 
"java -jar demo-jar-with-dependencies.jar" command.

This demo is actually part of a larger demo which show cases deploying the jar into a Docker swarm
environment in orer to showcase the benifits of using swarm as a developer.

You can check out the "mvpjava/docker-swarm-development-env" GitHub repository to get access to the full Docker swarm enviroment
